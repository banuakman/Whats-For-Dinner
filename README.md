# Whats for Dinner

## Motivation
The What's for Dinner Application is built to provide the user with an easy to navigate dinner selection process
With the ever looming question, "What's for dinner?" causing headaches and wasting time. The app narrows ones choices by delivering 3 randomly generated options with clickable images. 

## User Story
```
WHEN the user presses "What's for Dinner?" button
GIVEN 3 randomly generated options with clickable images. 
THEN user clicks image to select an dish or randomly generate another 3 options

WHEN a dish is selected, a drop down menu appears and the user can then choose to see a recipe or search nearby restaurants for the selected dish. 

WHEN the recipe is chosen,
SUMMARY and LINK to the recipe appears, as well as few links to similar recipes. 

WHEN a user chooses to search restaurants, they are prompted for their location. If they share location 
A MAP APPEARS with the results near their current location.
Markers with pop up windows as well as an easy to view list allow the user to be directed to website of their choosing. 
If the user decides not to share location. they can manually search the map in a search map by inputting a query and location. 

ON ALL THE WINDOWS, there is an option to randomly generate three more random dishes.
```

## Technologies Used
This application implements vanilla javaScript as well as jQuery to dynamically traverse DOM elements on the page. 
The deployed webpage utilizes the Spoonacular and Google Maps APIs to retrieve the recipes restaurants and location data that displayed to the user. 
The Foundation CSS framework was used to style the responsive layout.
