# Whats for Dinner

## Motivation

The What's for Dinner Application is built to provide the user with an easy to navigate dinner selection process
With the ever looming question, "What's for dinner?" causing headaches and wasting time. The app narrows ones choices by delivering 3 randomly generated options with clickable images.

## User Story

```
WHEN the user presses the "What's for Dinner?" button
GIVEN 3 randomly generated options with clickable images.
THEN the user clicks an image to select a dish, or randomly generate another 3 options

WHEN a dish is selected, a drop down menu appears and the user can then choose to view the recipe or search nearby restaurants for the selected dish.

WHEN the recipe is chosen,
SUMMARY and LINK to the recipe appears, as well as few links to similar recipes.

WHEN a user chooses to search restaurants, they are prompted for their location. If they share their location
A MAP APPEARS with the results near their current location.
Markers with pop up windows appear on the map, as well as an easy to view list to the side, directing the user to a website.
If the user decides not to share location, they can manually search the map in a search form by inputting a query and location.

ON ALL OF THE WINDOWS, there is an option to randomly generate three more dishes.
```

## Technologies Used

This application implements vanilla javaScript as well as jQuery to dynamically traverse DOM elements on the page.
The deployed webpage utilizes the Spoonacular and Google Maps APIs to retrieve the recipes, restaurants and location data displayed to the user.
The Foundation CSS framework was used to style the responsive layout.
